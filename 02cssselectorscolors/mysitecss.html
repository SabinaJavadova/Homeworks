<h3>Today topic is FashionWeek.</h3>
<br>
    <div class="giris">
        <p>A fashion week is a week-long fashion industry event where fashion designers, brands, or "houses" display their latest collections in runway fashion shows to buyers and the media which influences upcoming fashion trends for the current and approaching seasons.
            he most prominent fashion weeks are held in the fashion capitals of the world—in chronological order, New York City, London, Milan, and Paris, or the "Big Four".[3] The foundations of fashion week began in Paris in the late 1800s before spreading to New York, Milan, and London in the 20th century. What began as marketing garments in public spaces like racetracks grew into highly publicized events in themselves. In the 2000s, themes of sustainability began emerging at fashion weeks and grew popular across the next decade.

   <h1 class="hist">History</h1>
   <div class="orta">
    <p>One of history's first signs of a fashion week, or seasonal collection, can be traced back to fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth during the late 1800s. The concept of the fashion week began in Paris, when marketers used to hire women to wear couture items in public places, from racetracks to beauty salons.[4] These parades gradually became social events of their own. In France, runway shows are still called "défilés de mode" which when translated literally means "fashion shows" or "fashion parades." A style show is an occasion placed on by a style planner to exhibit their forthcoming line of dress as well as embellishments during Fashion Week. Style shows debut each season, especially the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons.[5]

        The first Paris Fashion Week was due to the work of designer Paul Poiret. Poiret was known as the King of Fashion and led the fashion world in the first decade of the 20th century. He wished to present his designs on live mobile bodies. Poiret decided that to make this idea a reality he would combine socializing and shopping by throwing multiple galas featuring his pieces. Guests were asked to dress in their best clothing to align with his lavish designs. As the shows continued they became less of a large affair and the invitations became more individualized. Fashion houses began to dress models in their collections in front of client-only guests. Unlike modern-day fashion shows photographers were prohibited due to tensions regarding copied designs.</p>

<h2>Paris Fashion Week</h2>
<p>Paris Fashion Week (French: Semaine de la mode de Paris) is a series of designer presentations held semi-annually in Paris, France, with spring/summer and autumn/winter events held each year. Dates are determined by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode. Paris Fashion Week is held at venues throughout the city.[1]

    In addition to ready-to-wear shows, there are men's and haute couture shows; these are held semiannually for the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons.[2] The haute couture collections are always presented and exhibited before the ready-to-wear collections, with there being a total of a little over 100 collections each season.[3] Also, every year, famous brands like Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Kenzo, Givenchy, and Céline host their shows in historical places such as the Carrousel du Louvre and the Grand Palais.[4][5</p>

        <h2>Milano Fashion Week</h2>
        <p>ilan Fashion Week is partially organized by the National Chamber of Italian Fashion (Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana), a non-profit association that disciplines, co-ordinates, and promotes the development of Italian fashion[7] and is responsible for hosting the fashion events and shows of Milan. The Camera Sindacale della Moda Italiana, was set up on 11 June 1958. This was the forerunner of the body which subsequently became the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana.Milan Fashion Week (Italian: Settimana della moda di Milano) is a clothing trade show held semi-annually in Milan, Italy. Upcoming autumn/winter fashions are showcased in February/March of each year, and upcoming spring/summer fashions are showcased in September/October of each year.

<h2>CAN ANYONE GO TO FASHION WEEK?</h2>
<p>FW is primarily an industry event, and access is generally restricted to fashion professionals, including designers, buyers, editors, photographers, celebrities, and influencers. The designers and fashion houses hosting the shows send out invitations.


    However, there are opportunities for the general public to get involved. Some weeks, like those in New York and London, started offering tickets to select shows and events. Additionally, many shows are live-streamed online since the pandemic. And for those who attend, it’s essential to plan well. Networking within the fashion industry can help secure invitations, and there are also contests and giveaways on social media that offer tickets to the public.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
    <p>Before mainstream fashion events like fashion week began incorporating sustainable fashion, brands like Patagonia practiced sustainability by designing garments out of recycled materials. The Copenhagen Fashion Summit was then established in 2009 to discuss social and environmental issues facing the fashion industry. Designers were called on to cut their total number of collections per year in exchange for more durable garments which extended lifespan and minimized waste.[6] Similarly, buyers were encouraged to purchase fewer longer lasting pieces. These informal initiatives stimulate a circular economy.</p>
